      There is no problem to trade with other nations. Infact we always say <em>VASUDEV KUTUMBAKAM</em>, the whole world is
      family. But remember what East India Company done. China is moving on the footsteps of East India company.
      China is giving loan to small countries which are not fit to take loan from IMF and other International sources. Now many of these
      countries are not able to pay loan back and china started using their land for different purposes.
      A African country <em>Djibouti</em> is now practically owned by china becouse they were unable to pay loan back.
      China is doing same thing with Asian countries like Pakistan, Nepal and Sri-lanka.
      <br>
      Also when china is responsible for Corona virus crises instead of helping other nations china is selling them faulty test kits and supplies.
      We can trust any other nation but not china. Also most electronics of china are of poor quality.
      <ul>
        <li>
          China believe in expanding. Most part of kashmir and Ladhak is operated by china and now china want collapse more land. Recently
          we lost our 20 brave soldiers encountering China. China is doing this with many other countries also.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h6>Our soldiers are answering china with bullets we have to do it with our wallets. Let's impose personal economic ban on china.</h6>

      <h3 id="possible">Is it possible to boycott china products? </h3>
     <h6>Inshort yes it is. Our import from china are 5 times more than our exports.
        But in last few days we have done same extra-ordinary things.
     </h6><ul>
       <li>India identifies 12 sectors in which we become self-reliant and global suppliers</li>
       <li>India makes 22% of generic medicine importing some basic materials from other countries but now
       we are making medicine such as HydroxyChloroquine on our own 100% Indian and this happened in less than 60 days </li>
       <li>In next 5 years India is planning to give incentives worth RS. 40,000 crores to campanies to make and export mobile phones from india</li>
       <li>India notifies FDI policy change mandating prior nod for border-sharing nation .</li>
       <li>Textile companies shut down due to covid-19. But they found opportunity, they started making PPE's and now India become second largest PPE manufacturer
       in 60 days. This industry worth $60 Billion by 2025.   </li>
       <li>Tribal women from Chattisgarh use Mahuha flower to make alcohal, base for hand sanitizer. They don't wait for others and stared making India Atma-Nirbhar.
       So next time when you are about to complain think once more.</li>
       <li>1000 campanies are shifting their manufacturing from china to India. 300 confirms on paper.</li>
       <li>India reserve land twice Luxembourg's size to firms leaving china and settle in India.</li>
       <li>Many Apps from china found guilty in stealing data of consumer and using them against our nation. Also most
       of them contain cringe and abusive content such as promoting acid attacks. They are completely waste of time.</li>
</ul>
<h6>yes it is true we can't stop using chinese hardwares in one day. But we have untapped potential to make our own things and now we are unlocking it.</h6>

  Why Indian Government is not banning chinese Products?
</h3>
 It is simple. World Trade Organisation set certain rules for trading. Due to this we can't ban import from china directly but we can find substitutes.
 As we see above we are doing it. Here some steps taken by Government.
 <ul>
   <li>Railways cancels 471 crore project awarded to china firm </li>
   <li>BSNL to stop using Chinese equipments.</li>
   <li> RS.1200 crores+ rail project where china firm was lowest bidder expected to be rejected.</li>
   <li> Indian gov
    will provide tailor made facilities for companies who want to manufacture in India.</li>
   <li>In next 5 years India is planning to give incentives worth RS. 40,000 crores to campanies to make and export mobile phones from india</li>
<li>Many other steps are also taken under Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan to promote manufacturing in India </li>

<h3 id="altForHard">Alternatives for Chinese Hardwares</h3>
We can easily find alternatives of chinese apps but to get rid of chinese hardware is not easy.
Almost all companies import some parts of their products from china. But we can find alternatives of
companies that are completely chinese and all the revenue goes to China. With that we have to keep finding
possibilities to manufacture our own things and we are doing it very rapidly. Till then the alternatives are:

    <th>Alternatives</th>

    <td>MI/ Realme/ oppo/ vivo/ oneplus/ lenovo
